This repository works towards question #15 on the webpage https://www.notion.so/Analytics-Bounties-for-Alchemix-ffd6c25bdef3486c9b8dfa9476ac6a39. This question revolves around analyzing the activity of the top 25 most active holders of the Alchemix (ALCX) cryptocurrency with the core functions of Transmuter, Alchemist/Vault, and 4 farm pools using Flipside Crypto data. My analysis looks at the the transactions as a snapshot, percent of total activity with the functions, and with a temporal aspect.

My solution is located in a jupyter notebook. The notebook can also use real-time data to update the attached graphs, and uses the backend.py file to format data and perform computation.

I have included multiple ways to view the report:

1) Active_Holder_Interactions.ipynb --> This is a jupyter notebook. The code can be actually run in here by execting "jupyter notebook Large_Holder_Activity.ipynb" in terminal from this directory.

2) Active_Holder_Interactions.pdf --> This is an exported PDF document of the write-up and code included in the jupyter notebook. This also includes the graphs that the code generates.
